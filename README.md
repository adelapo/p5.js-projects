# p5.js Projects

These are all the p5.js projects I'm working on. They will tend to fall into three sometimes overlapping categories:

1. My own personal projects and ideas.
2. Stuff I learned from [Dan Shiffman on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman).
3. Stuff I'm teaching to students.

Stay tuned for more awesome stuff!
